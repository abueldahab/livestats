/!\ This is Work in Progress ! /!\

A little JS/Php solution to get a real-time view of the visitors connected
to your website. The goal is to use this info to build this following dashboard
widget:

+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|   42   |   36   |    2   |   4    |
|  Total |  Read  |  Write |  Idle  |
+--------+--------|--------+--------|

Requirements:
- Javascript turned on in the client browser.
- PHP 5.1+ (requires PDO SQLite, available by default http://php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-sqlite.php)

Information currently collected:
- Number of visitors
- State of each visitor: Idle, Reading or Writing

Future information we could collect:
- IP
- URL visited
- Referer
- Keywords

Future work:
- API to track a given information

---------------------------------------------------
Dashboard:
I'll first write a very simple page showing the content of the DB.
Then I think I'll collect IPs and plot that on Google Maps.
