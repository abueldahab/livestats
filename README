/!\ This is Work in Progress ! /!\

A little JS/Php solution to get a real-time view of the visitors connected
to your website.

Requirements:
- Javascript turned on in the client browser.
- PHP and SQLite enabled on the server

Information currently collected:
- Number of visitors
- State of each visitor: Idle, Reading or Writing

Future information we could collect:
- IP
- URL visited
- Referer
- Keywords

Future work:
- API to track a given information

---------------------------------------------------
Dashboard:
I'll first right a very simple page showing the content of the DB.
Then I think I'll collect IPs and plot that on Google Maps.
